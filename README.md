![iot-7850194_1280](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByYmDBZWkx.jpg)


> In this article, we will discuss on the topic of environmental sustainability in the context of Web3. There are many misconceptions and concerns surrounding the environmental impact of blockchain technology, the foundation of Web3 which keeps hindering its mass adoption. However, as we will later find out, Web3 also presents unique opportunities to address environmental challenges and contribute to a more sustainable future.





# Introduction

Web3 is the internet that is commonly called the decentralized web. The "decentralized web" is the is the third generation or model of the internet. The internet was originally created to improve communication. Instead, it transformed society: from 1990 to 2004, we did see an expansion of information; from 2005 to 2020, there was media disruption; and from 2020 onwards, we're experiencing disruption of ownership. By 2030, it would have transformed every part of our jobs, do business and live.

As we experience this significant shift from the previous internet models - Web1 & Web2, we confirms the numerous limitations of the centralized internet being addressed, where a few large corporations control user data and access.

> **Hint: Web2 is also called the centralized internet.**
> 

But as more individuals grew weary of this centralized system, the idea of a decentralized internet ‚Äî Web3 ‚Äî gained more momentum. 

This new model is  built on blockchain technology and supports new economic and social models, aiming for a safer, more secure and less censorship-prone internet.


# Understanding Web3

Web3 shows proof of how much the internet has changed throughout three different phases. We have now reached the internet that we can read, write and own at the same time, which introduces a whole new dimension: digital ownership. This means that users can now have actual ownership and control over their digital data and assets in addition to being able to browse and produce content. The way we use and profit from the internet has fundamentally changed as a result of this move toward ownership.


Unlike Web2, where data is stored on centralized servers controlled by large corporations, Web3 uses blockchain technology to distribute data across a network of computers (nodes), ensuring that no single entity has control over the entire system. Since there's no centralized authority, there's no single point of failure making it much more difficult for hackers to bring the entire system to a halt.


The blockchain technology, that you've always heard about is the backbone of Web3. It is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively. This technology ensures transparency and security in data handling. In the context of Web3, blockchain enables the creation of innovative applications that run on a peer-to-peer network, providing a more secure and transparent way to conduct digital interactions.



These Web3 technologies offers a range of benefits (Google is your friend üòè), introducing all-round applications that expand their possibilities in finance, governance, and data management, all with an emphasis on decentralization, transparency, and user ownership. 

Let's take a look at the key concepts that makes up the Web3 space.

### Key Concepts of Web3

**#1: Decentralization -**  By dispersing ownership and management of digital assets and services among a network of users and nodes, Web3 seeks to lessen the concentration of power and data in the hands of a small number of powerful technological companies.

**#2: Blockchain Technology -** This  technology serves as the foundation for Web3's decentralization. It functions as a distributed ledger that securely, openly, and irrevocably records transactions and data, guaranteeing that no one party may alter or manipulate the information.

**#3: Cryptocurrencies -** Web3 relies heavily on digital currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Ripple,etc. They offer a peer-to-peer, decentralized payment system that eliminates the need for **middlemen** like banks and permits safe, transparent transactions.

**#4: Smart Contracts -** These are contracts that automatically carry out their terms because they have been written directly into a code. Decentralized apps (dApps) can be developed on top of blockchain systems thanks to smart contracts, which offer automated and safe transaction execution.

**#5: Decentralized Applications (dApps) -** dApps are programs that are **not hosted on a centralized server** but instead operate on a decentralized network. To allow users to communicate securely with the app and one another, they make use of smart contracts and blockchain technology.

**#6: DAOs -** DAOs is an acronym for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. A DAO is an internet-native corporations or communities collectively owned and managed by its members that follows the regulations that are stored on a blockchain as computer programs. To guarantee that everyone in the organization has a say, they have built-in treasuries and make decisions by voting and proposals.

**#7: NFTs -** Non fungible tokens are digital assets that grants ownership of a virtual good, like an online collectible or a work of digital art. It enables anyone to own a portion of the internet.

**#8: DeFi -** Decentralized Finance as its called, takes away banks and other institutions control over money, financial services, and products.

**#9: Interoperability -** Web3 seeks to establish an ecosystem of interconnected blockchain networks, dApps, and services that can easily communicate with one another, facilitating a more transparent and cooperative online environment.

**#10: Identity and Privacy -** Web3 places a strong emphasis on user-controlled digital identities and enhanced privacy via decentralized identity solutions and cryptography. This enables users to keep control over their personal information and only reveal it when required.

**#11: Decentralized Identifiers (DID) -** Traditional identifiers, such as your legal name or email address, are dependent on third parties, such as email providers and governments. DIDs are unique in that the individual issues, holds, and controls them.



# Environmental Sustainability in the Context of Web3

With all of the key concepts explained above, you can tell that not only is the Web technology changing, but culture is as well changing redefining the way we live and work. It has proven its potential to transform various industries including finance, supply chain, healthcare, content creation, and more, by providing decentralized, trustless, and transparent solutions. However, this opens up new conversations and ruminating thoughts on its impact on the environment, its sustainability, and security especially because of the energy-intensive nature of some of their mechanisms. 


![technology-6742648_1280](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1glwBWZyl.jpg)

Many people view blockchain's energy consumption as a drawback because Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms, like those of Bitcoin and Ethereum, require a significant amount of electricity, which is often sourced from non-renewable energy sources, having a significant impact on the environment and contributing to climate change. As a result, the unresolved conversations surrounding these technologies have increased and are gaining traction, which has led to the ineffective mass adoption of this game-changing technology. 

This is because public perception matters greatly for the growth and development of Web3 technology, it affects how people accept and use these new technologies. Similar to any other new technology, people are needed to believe in it, support it, and use it, Web3 needs this widespread support to work effectively. When people understand and trust Web3, they're more willing to try new things like digital wallets and blockchain applications. This trust also encourages companies to invest money and resources into developing Web3 projects.

However, negative experiences like cryptocurrency scams or concerns about environmental impact can make people hesitant to embrace Web3. The way the public views Web3 also influences how governments create rules and regulations for these technologies. Plus, since Web3 can be complicated to understand, people need to feel confident enough to learn about and use these new tools. Simply put, if people don't believe in or trust Web3, it won't succeed, no matter how innovative the technology might be.


# Common Myths About Web3 and Environmental Impact

## Myth 1: All Blockchain Technologies Are Environmentally Harmful


Among the most widespread myth about blockchain technology is this one. The misconception likely stems from the significant energy consumption of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin. However, not all blockchain technologies are created equal. Critics often paint all blockchain systems with the same broad brush of environmental criticism. Not all have the same environmental footprints. The energy consumption of a blockchain largely depends on the consensus mechanism it uses.  PoW requires extensive computational power to validate transactions, leading to high energy use. However, other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), are designed to be much more energy-efficient.

PoS works by selecting validators based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. This process requires significantly less computational power than PoW, drastically reducing energy consumption. Examples of PoS blockchains include Ethereum (after its transition from PoW), Cardano, and Polkadot. Therefore, while some blockchains are energy-intensive, others have been specifically designed to minimize environmental impact.

If we lump all blockchain technologies together under the label of "environmentally harmful," we overlook the significant advancements and variations within this field.

These are examples of environmentally-conscious blockchain

### Examples of Environmentally Conscious Blockchains

1. **Solana**
   - Uses a Proof-of-History mechanism
   - Claims to use less energy than 2-3 Google searches per transaction

2. **Cardano**
   - Operates on Proof-of-Stake
   - Uses less than 0.01% of Bitcoin's energy consumption

3. **Algorand**
   - Carbon-negative blockchain
   - Implements a Pure Proof-of-Stake protocol




## Myth 2: Proof-of-Work (PoW) is the Only Consensus Mechanism


Many people assume that PoW is the only way to achieve consensus in a blockchain network, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Without PoW, several alternative consensus mechanisms still exist, each with its advantages and environmental profiles.

### Alternative Consensus Mechanisms

1. **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):** As mentioned, PoS selects validators based on their stake in the network. It significantly reduces energy consumption because it doesn't require solving complex mathematical problems. It is 99.95% more efficient than PoW and is used by Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, and others

2. **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS):** This variant of PoS involves token holders voting for delegates to validate transactions and secure the network. DPoS further optimizes the efficiency and scalability of PoS. They often have a high transaction throughput and is often used by EOS and TRON.

3. **Proof-of-Authority (PoA):** PoA relies on a small number of validators (authorized by the network) to create new blocks. This method is highly efficient and can handle high throughput, making it suitable for private blockchains. Its used in supply chain and enterprise solutions.

4. **Proof-of-Burn (PoB):** PoB involves validators burning (destroying) a portion of their cryptocurrency to earn the right to mine. This mechanism ensures a form of investment in the network's security and efficiency without high energy demands.

5. **Proof-of-Capacity (PoC):** PoC leverages hard drive space instead of computational power for mining, making it an energy-efficient alternative to PoW.

6. **Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT):** This is an energy-efficient consensus through voting, it operates with high transaction finality and is used in Hyperledger Fabric.

7. **Proof-of-Space (PoSpace):** This is a consensus that's validated based on storage capacity. It is more environmentally friendly than PoW. Its frequently used by the Chia Network.


### Comparative Analysis of Few Consensus Mechanism


| Mechanism | Energy Usage | Security | Scalability 
|-----------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| PoW       | Very High    | High     | Low         |
| PoS       | Very Low     | High     | High        |
| DPoS      | Low          | Medium   | Very High   |
| PoA       | Minimal      | Medium   | Very High   |



All these consensus mechanisms shows the diverse approaches within the blockchain space, changing the misconception that PoW is the sole method for achieving decentralized consensus.



## Myth 3: Crypto Mining Always Wastes Energy

The notion that mining cryptocurrency constantly loses energy has been overgeneralized and fails to take into account the larger picture. Even though it is true that mining operations especially for PoW blockchains consume significant amounts of electricity, it doesn't mean that all this energy is wasted. There are improvements in the way this crypto mining is being operated. Lets see a few:
 
1. **Renewable Energy Initiatives:** Many mining operations are shifting towards renewable energy sources to power their activities. By using solar, wind, or hydroelectric power, the carbon footprint of mining can be significantly reduced. Regions like Iceland and certain areas in China use geothermal and hydroelectric power, respectively, to run mining farms.

2. **Energy Optimization:** Advances in hardware efficiency mean that miners can achieve the same computational output with less energy. Mining operations are continually upgrading to more efficient hardware to reduce energy consumption.

3. **Economic Incentives:** In many cases, the economic cost of energy forces miners to seek out the most efficient and cost-effective solutions. This often leads to the adoption of energy-saving technologies and practices.

4. **Heat Reutilization:** Some mining operations are exploring ways to reutilize the heat generated by mining rigs for other purposes, such as heating buildings or greenhouses, thus contributing to energy efficiency and waste reduction.
